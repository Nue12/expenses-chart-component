# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component

![Design preview for the Expenses chart component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

In this challenge, the graph is not only built by HTML, CSS 
I built the graph by using data from json file and calculate the number and transform into graph. So codes are clean and reusable.
